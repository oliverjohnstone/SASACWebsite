		<p class="bold">Clubhouse and Bar</p>
		We have our own clubhouse with a fully stocked bar. Our clubhouse has just undergone a repaint and a nice new floor and we 
		are in the midst of a sport England grant to renovate the pool, this will include new shower cubicles, toilets, pool surrounding and
		much more.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Compressor</p>
		The costs of all the air fills from the club compressor are included in a divers membership feeâ€™s, it will save you both time and 
		money compared with getting your airs fills at a dive site. We can supply double filtered air to 300 bar. All diving members are 
		trained in the use of the air station so they can fill their own cylinders at any time and not just when the club is open on a Wednesday 
		night, making that last minute get away even easier.
	</p>

 	<p>
		<p class="bold">Booster Pump</p>
		A Booster Pump works very much like a standard air compressor. It will take a high volume gas at low pressure (minimum of 30bar) and pump 
		it into a lower volume cylinder at higher pressure. In the UK the J cylinders of diving grade oxygen we use are generally delivered with 
		only 200 bar of pressure in them, if you want to fill your Rebreather Oxygen cylinders to 232bar you will need access to a booster pump. 
		It also has the major benefit of being able to help with the blending of Nitrox fills for Open circuit divers as well. You will no longer 
		have to drain down your cylinders as we can virtually guarantee to have enough high pressure oxygen to boost into your cylinders, therefore 
		saving time and money. Also if you had any part filled trimix cylinders you could us this pump to consolidate the gas and either free up 
		twinsets or be able to make best use of the remaining gas. As St Albans Sub Aqua Club wanted to promote safe diving and has an expanding 
		number of Rebreather and Technical divers it took the decision to invest in one and therefore we can now offer this service to our members.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Kit Hire</p>
		Any club member that has had the appropriate training in the use of a piece of equipment can rent it out from our club. When you first
		start learning to dive, you can pay a small sum to rent the equipment for a year and this gives you time to progressively buy most of your
		own kit.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Nitrox</p>
		SASAC has banks of Diving Grade Oxygen to allow appropriately trained members to supply Nitrox (Enriched Air) to qualified divers.  
		We can also supply 100% oxygen up to 232bar for re-breather divers via the use of the club booster pump. We run in house Skill Development 
		Courses in gas blending which will give you the qualification to blend your own gas.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Club Pool</p>
		Our club pool will be filled all year round after the renovations, making for the perfect area to complete your Ocean diver training, test
		out new kit or just go for a swim. Our pool is also rented out to a canoeing club and there is talk of some triathlon competitors using 
		the pool to acclimatise.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Club RHIB</p>
		We have our own RHIB (Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boat) which can be used by any diving member to organise your own diving trip or for those
		looking for more of an adventure. We also offer the Boat Handling and the Diver Coxon SDC at our club.
	</p>

	<img src="/assets/img/aed.jpg"> -->
	<p>
		<p class="bold">AED</p>
		The AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a piece of first aid equipment that we hope never to use but that is carried on all trips
		where one is not available. We also teach a AED SDC along with the O2 admin for divers and the first aid course; a large portion of our 
		membership has undertaken these courses.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Regional SDCs</p>
		There is a large number of additional courses that BSAC offers and many of them we can teach in our own clubhouse, else they can be taught
		by one of our neighbouring clubs. These courses are excellently taught by one of our many instructors and are well worth attending. A full list
		of BSAC SDCs can be found on the <a href="http://www.bsac.com" target="_blank">BSAC website</a>.
	</p>
	<!-- <img src="/assets/img/sdc.jpg"> -->

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Lecture Theatre</p>
		Our lecture theatre is where we teach all the theory lessons for a course, its also a great place to present something or for other clubs
		to use for there various events. The whole clubhouse and/or the lecture theatre including the pool can also be rented out for parties or events.
