	<p>St Albans Sub Aqua Club has a newly renovated lido. All you need to do in order to make use of the pool is to become
		a swimming member of our club. Swimming membership entitles you to all the benefits of social members but with the added benefit of the pool (
		a great place to relax on a hot summers evening).</p>

	<p>The cost of membership is Â£40.00 per adult and your children under the age of 18 enter for free. Any children under the age of 18 must be 
		accompanied by a parent/ guardian who is a Cottonmill Swimming member. There must be one adult to every 2 children and you may bring up to three
		guests three times per year. As a swimming member you will need to undergo basic rescue skills training (provided free of charge), the reason for
		this is to ensure that everyone is using the pool safely and if something were to happen then there's someone that can help.</p>

	<h2>Signing Up</h2>

	<p>To sign up, please contact our membership secretary, <a href="mailto:membership@sasac.co.uk">Phil</a> and he'll arrange everything.</p>
