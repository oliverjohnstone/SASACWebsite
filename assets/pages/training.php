<p>We train all levels of divers from Ocean Diver through to Advanced Diver and can mentor any one who wants to progress to First Class. 
	We have an active training programme and teach all year round.</p>

<p>Here is a little more information on each of the levels:</p>

<h3>Ocean Diver</h3>
<p>The Ocean Diver course is the BSAC (British Sub Aqua Club) entry-level course. Achieving this qualification allows you to be able to 
dive to 20 metres. The course itself consists of a series of seven lectures followed by an exam, five pool sessions and a swimming 
assessment and then five open water dives, which will either be in a fresh water quarry, the sea, or ideally a combination of both 
situations to allow you to gain a wider and well rounded experience.</br></br>

The full definition of an Ocean Diver is the following:</br>
An Ocean Diver is defined as a diver who is competent to conduct dives:
	<ul>
		<li>with another Ocean Diver or with a Sports Diver, within the restrictions of the conditions already encountered during their training</li>
		<li>with a Dive Leader or higher grade, to expand their experience beyond the conditions encountered during their training, under the supervision of a Dive Manager</li>
		<li>to a depth which is initially limited to the maximum experienced during training, but which can subsequently be extended progressively, under the supervision of a Qualified Instructor (QI), to a maximum of 20m</li>
		<li>using breathing gas mixes of 21%, 32% or 36% O2</li>
		<li>not requiring mandatory decompression stops</li>
		<li>under the on-site supervision of a Dive Manager with respect to site selection, conditions and dive plan</li>
		<li>where other divers, capable of providing assistance and rescue, are available at the surface</li>
		<li>within BSAC safe diving recommendations</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Sports Diver</h3>
<p>The second level in the BSAC diving qualifications is that of Sports Diver, this qualification once completed, along with the additional 
	depth experience will allow you to be able to dive to 35 metres. The course is comprised of six lectures followed by an exam, one pool 
	session, a dry practical assessment and five open water dives, which will either be in a fresh water quarry, the sea, or ideally a 
	combination of both situations to allow you to gain a wider and well rounded experience.</br></br>

The full definition of a Sports Diver is the following:</br>
A Sports Diver is defined as a diver who is competent to:
	<ul>
		<li>conduct dives with an Ocean Diver within the restrictions of the conditions already encountered by the Ocean Diver during their training, and under the supervision of a Dive Manager</li>
		<li>conduct dives with another Sports Diver, within the restrictions of the conditions already encountered during their training or previous experience</li>
		<li>conduct dives with a Dive Leader or higher grade, to expand their experience beyond that previously encountered, under the supervision of a Dive Manager</li>
		<li>dive to a depth which is initially limited to 20 metres, but which can be progressively extended to 35 metres</li>
		<li>use breathing gas mixes up to Nitrox 36</li>
		<li>plan and conduct dives requiring mandatory decompression stops</li>
		<li>rescue a casualty and provide Basic Life Support</li>
		<li>conduct dives where other divers, capable of providing assistance and rescue management skills, are available at the surface</li>
		<li>conduct dives within BSAC safe diving practice recommendations</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Dive Leader</h3>
<p>The third level in the BSAC diving qualifications is that of Dive Leader, this qualification once completed, along with the additional 
	depth experience will allow you to be able to dive to 50 metres. The course is comprised of twelve lectures followed by an exam, 
	two dry practical assessments and seven open water dives, and a series of an additional twenty dives which need to meet certain conditions, 
	these dives can either be in a fresh water quarry, the sea, or ideally a combination of both situations to allow you to gain a wider and well 
	rounded experience.</br></br>

	The full definition of a dive leader is the following:</br>
	A Dive Leader is defined as a diver who:
	<ul>
		<li>can plan and lead a range of dives including those requiring detailed dive, air and decompression requirements planning</li>
		<li>has the skill and level of knowledge to progressively extend his/her skills to take part in a wide range of adventurous dives</li>
		<li>has rescue management skills</li>
		<li>is competent to manage and supervise branch dives to locations well known to the branch, or using experienced skippers, or in conditions not normally described as 'challenging'</li>
		<li>can dive to depths, which can be further extended from those experienced earlier in diver training. All diving to be conducted within safe diving practices</li>
		<li>can conduct dives with divers of any grade, to expand their experience beyond that previously encountered by those divers, under the supervision of a Dive Manager</li>
		<li>can conduct experience-building dives with trainee Ocean Divers, within the restrictions of the conditions already encountered by the trainee Ocean Diver, and under the supervision of a Dive Manager</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Advanced Diver</h3>
<p>The fourth level in the BSAC diving qualifications is that of Advanced Diver, this qualification once completed, along with the additional 
	depth experience will also allow you to be able to dive to 50 metres. The course is comprised of four lectures followed by an exam, 
	two dry practical assessments and two open water dives, and a series of an additional twenty dives which need to meet certain conditions, 
	these dives can either be in a fresh water quarry, the sea, or ideally a combination of both situations to allow you to gain a wider and 
	well rounded experience.</br></br>

	The full definition of a dive leader is the following:
	An Advanced Diver is defined as a diver who is comprehensively trained, experienced and responsible and who can manage and supervise:
	<ul>
		<li>a wide range of adventurous and challenging diving activities</li>
		<li>branch diving expeditions to explore unfamiliar locations</li>
		<li>branch diving activities including dives utilising developing technology and techniques</li>
	</ul>

	While Advanced Divers do not necessarily need to be qualified to use emerging technologies themselves, they need to know sufficient 
	about them to understand how to safely incorporate them within branch diving.
</p>

<h3>First Class Diver</h3>
<p>The first Class diver qualification is the highest non-instructional award the BSAC offer. All Assessments are completed on a National Level.</br>
	What is a First Class Diver?
	There are only hundreds of divers that have reached this grade since the formation of BSAC. As opposed to the thousands of divers who that have 
	completed the lower grades. The qualification carries considerable gravitas within the diving community. A First Class Diver is the highest 
	diver grade available within the BSAC and is defined as a diver who has:
	<ul>
		<li>a level of practical diving skills and knowledge beyond advanced diver</li>
		<li>the ability to organise groups of divers and lead major diving expeditions to achieve specific aims or objectives</li>
		<li>the ability and knowledge to contribute to the BSAC at a branch, regional and national level</li>
	</ul>
</br>
	Why do people complete this level?</br>
	There are many reasons why divers want to achieve First Class success. Some of the main drivers are:
	<ul>
		<li>for pure personal achievement</li>
		<li>to be at the very top of the BSAC diving community and therefore a role model for others within the branch / centre, region and country</li>
		<li>to confirm their diving ability by being assessed by the most experienced instructors in the BSAC at a national venue</li>
		<li>to confirm their ability to run safe but challenging regional, national and international diving expeditions</li>
		<li>to progress on from Advanced Instructor to National Instructor; you must have achieved First Class status to qualify for the National Instructor assessment</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p class="bold">Along side the standard qualification levels we also teach the following Skill Development Courses within the club.</p>

<h3>Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Course</h3>
<p>Aim of Course: To train divers and others involved in BSAC diving activities with little or no knowledge and experience of 
	Automated External Defibrillators (AED), in their use during a diving emergency situation according to Resuscitation Council (UK) 
	guidelines, with particular attention to precautions required in the diving environment.</p>

<h3>Buoyancy and Trim Workshop</h3>
<p>Perfecting buoyancy control is a major step towards safe, comfortable diving, where the diver can relax and move gracefully in 
	the underwater environment. Few skills can do as much as buoyancy control to improve one's diving: it affects all that we do 
	underwater. It saves breathing gas, saves energy, builds confidence in one's ability to dive safely and makes for more fun. 
	Not only that, it helps us to avoid damage to the underwater environment and at the same time it makes us look and feel good as divers.
	Correct trim (adjusting diving equipment to attain correct balance and attitude in the water) also contributes to easier control of body 
	position, more relaxed and comfortable diving, and reduced gas and energy consumption.</p>

<h3>Chart work and Position Fixing Course</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To teach the basic techniques of marine navigation and dive site location to a level which will help them as active divers 
	in planning and managing dives undertaken by a typical BSAC branch. It is a practical course, which has the students using charts and 
	chart work instruments right from the start. It culminates in a day at sea, navigating to two dive sites and locating them by echo 
	sounder, directed by a voyage plan built up gradually over the first day. The first part of the course teaches the basics of charts, 
	measurement and tides, interspersed with exercises. This is followed by position fixing techniques and a session on the specific problems 
	involved in locating dive sites. The last part of day one looks at how all the techniques are brought together to create a voyage plan.</p>

<h3>Dive Planning and Management Course</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To teach divers the importance of Dive Planning and Management, and the correct procedures for doing so; the need for a 
	suitably qualified and experienced person to perform the function; and to give divers practical experience of dive management.</p>

<h3>First Aid for Divers</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To teach the basics of first aid likely to be needed in the diving environment, making use of the resources likely to be
	available at the time including improvisation of dressings and splints using materials and equipment commonly available at the dive 
	site or in a boat. The course focuses on the recognition and treatment of conditions, which are not covered in the BSAC Diver Training 
	Programme.</p>

<h3>Life Saver and Advanced Lifesaver Award</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To examine, under pool and sheltered water conditions, lifesaving proficiency specifically applicable to divers. A secondary
	aim is to examine the ability of divers to make use of their rescue skills in more general non-diving situations. The examination covers 
	rescue methods suitable for use from shore or boat, by rescuers, as they are likely to be dressed at the time, using aids that may reasonably 
	be expected to be available.</p>

<h3>Oxygen Administration</h3>
<p>This course teaches the basics of oxygen administration, the circumstances in which it can be given and to whom it can be given.</p>

<h3>Practical Rescue Management Course</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To teach divers how to manage the resources at their disposal in order to make the most effective use of them in a rescue 
	situation. The course also provides an opportunity for further instruction in personal rescue skills to complement those undertaken 
	during diver training, but the emphasis will be on the development of rescue management skills.
</p>

<h3>Search and Recovery</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To instruct divers in the correct techniques and procedures involved in search and recovery projects, and to provide 
	practical experience of underwater search methods and the use of buoyancy for lifting objects.
</p>

<h3>Underwater Photography Course</h3>
<p>Course Aim: To teach the basic use of a compact digital camera and housing to students with little or no knowledge and experience 
	of underwater photography.</p>

<h3>Wreck Appreciation</h3>
<p>The main aims of the course are to show students:
	<ul>
		<li>what wrecks are - historical time capsules, artificial reefs and havens for marine life</li>
		<li>how to get information on wreck sites</li>
		<li>how to identify the major parts of a wreck</li>
		<li>the additional equipment and techniques used for wreck diving</li>
		<li>marine diversity on wrecks</li>
		<li>laws and responsibilities relating to 'wreck'</li>
		<li>how to make basic site sketches</li>
		<li>encourage further wreck study</li>
	</ul>
