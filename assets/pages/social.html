	<p>The SASAC clubhouse bar is open on a Wednesday evening until 11pm and this is always a good opportunity to catch up with other members. In addition, there are a number of organised events throughout the year, including the annual dinner dance in February and our very own version of 'It's A Knock Out' in the summer. For upcoming events click <a href="#" onclick="$('#CalendarP').click(); return false;">here</a>.</p>
