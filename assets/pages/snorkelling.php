	<p>St Albans Sub Aqua Club is not only a club for divers, we also have a group of BSAC snorkellers who also meet to play
		underwater hockey on a Wednesday and Thursday evening at Westminster lodge swimming pool. We can teach anyone to become
		a fully qualified BSAC Snorkel Diver.</p>

	<p>Snorkelling is great fun, easy to learn and an ideal way to build up confidence in the water. It is accessible to anyone -
		young or old - and is an enjoyable way to get the whole family involved.</p>

	<p>We run an introduction to snorkelling course 6 Thursday evenings during the school term at Westminster lodge for just 
		&pound;15. Please contact <a href="mailto:ali.humphrey@hotmail.com">ali.humphrey@hotmail.com</a> to book in your lessons
		today.</p>
