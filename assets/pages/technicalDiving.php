<p>Lets start by what is the definition of technical diving?</br></br>
One such definition is: a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving" target="_blank">scuba diving</a> that exceeds the conventional 
scope (in terms of depth, bottom time and type of diving) of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_diving" target="_blank">recreational diving</a>, although the vast majority of technical 
divers dive for recreation and no other purpose. Technical divers require advanced training, extensive experience, specialized equipment and 
often breathe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas" target="_blank">breathing gases</a> other than 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air" target="_blank">air</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_nitrox" target="_blank">
'standard' Nitrox</a> (an enriched air mix with either 32% or 36% O2).</p>

<p>Until fairly recently it was thought that any diving with any gas mix other than air was technical diving, 
	however the use of Nitrox 32 and 36% is now taught in many entry level scuba diving courses e.g. with the BSAC.</p>

<p>So what is exceeding the conventional scope?</br></br>

	Again this has a variety of definitions in the main this is 
	considered to be and one or combination of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Beyond recreational depths (for BSAC this means 35 metres for some agencies this will be 40 metres)</li>
		<li>Involves decompression diving - this is a planned stop to allow your body to release the nitrogen which has been absorbed during the dive in a controlled manner</li>
		<li>Mixed gas - e.g. adding Helium into the breathing gas mix</li>
		<li>Wreck penetration</li>
		<li>Cave diving (beyond 30M away from an exit point)</li>
		<li>Ice diving (there may be no clear exit point)</li>
		<li>Diving on a rebreather, although this may change in the future as you can now dive on some rebreathers with out any diving experience at all</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p class="bold">So what can we offer as a club?</p>
<p>I am going to split this into two sections - for those already trained and for those want to progress.</p>

<p><span class="bold">For those already trained. </span>There are several disciplines covered by the above definitions of technical diving;
	For the diver who has completed the ADP - Accelerated decompression course, a twin set course, or one of the mixed gas courses, we run 
	some deeper diving trips each year as well as regular trips to Chepstow to keep your skills up. For those into their cave diving - 
	we have two cave divers in the club, who regularly head out on trips to challenge their need to be under ground. For those who are 
	rebreather divers we have around ten rebreather divers in the club currently (and eleventh is waiting for delivery and training in 
	order to join the ranks) on a variety of units, although the primary unit of choice appears to be the Inspiration. We have not yet 
	completed any rebreather only trips as we tend to integrate into the club as 'normal' divers, at least as normal as any diver can beâ€¦. 
	We do however support each other, and will have refresher dives in quarries to practice skills on a regular basis. Ice diving is 
	something we may look into more next winter - as we have our own open air pool which we normally empty over winter - however next year 
	we may keep it full and given how cold the winters have been we may be able to run a course in this without setting foot outside St Albans!</p>

<p><span class="bold">For those who wish to train,</span> we have instructors within the club currently who can train you on all the technical 
courses that BSAC have to offer, from the accelerated deco course to rebreathers and trimix. We also have access to instructors outside 
of BSAC if you want to train with another agency, but wish to join the club and come along on the dives we offer. If you want more details 
on any of the above come down and see us on a Wednesday night.</p>
