	<p>Welcome to St Albans Sub Aqua Club's website, we are an active scuba diving club based in St Albans. We are currently looking for new members
		to join our club and learn to dive. Diving is a unique experience on par with nothing else, it is like experiencing a whole different world and we would like to share this experience with as many people as we can, so why not come down to the club for a try dive and see if you will enjoy diving as much as our current members do.</p>
	<p>We are a branch of the British Sub Aqua Club (<a href="http://bsac.com" target="_blank">BSAC</a>) and have plenty to offer for both those new to scuba diving and experienced divers looking to go on trips or advance their skills. SASAC has its own clubhouse, which is open from 8pm-late every Wednesday, including a lecture room where all the theory lessons for our various training courses take place, and a licensed bar.</p>
