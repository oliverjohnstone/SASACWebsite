		<p class="bold">Clubhouse and Bar</p>
		We have our own clubhouse with a fully stocked bar. Our clubhouse has just undergone a repaint and a nice new floor and we 
		are in the midst of a sport England grant to renovate the pool, this will include new shower cubicles, toilets, pool surrounding and
		much more.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Compressor</p>
		The club compressor is free to use for all diving members, it can save a lot of time and money off getting fills at a dive site and
		you can fill your 300bar cylinders. All diving members are trained in the use of the compressor and it is well maintained by our resident
		engineer, Alan Mayford.
	</p>

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Booster Pump</p>
		A booster pump is a type of compressor that can be used to top up cylinders to the required pressure. Our booster pump can be taken 
		on dive trips to provide easy and cheap access to compressed air. Booster pumps are especially useful for longer trips and the rebreather and
		Nitrox divers in the club.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Kit Hire</p>
		Any club member that has had the appropriate training in the use of a piece of equipment can rent it out from our club. When you first
		start learning to dive, you can pay a small sum to rent the equipment for a year and this gives you time to progressively buy most of your
		own kit.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Oxygen Banks</p>
		We have a set of Oxygen banks in the compressor room, this allows all our trained members to use Nitrox (enriched air) to dive and for 
		our rebreather friends to fill up their cylinders with 100% O2. We also provide Skill Development Courses in gas blending which will
		give you the qualification to blend your own gas mixes.
	</p>

	<img src="/assets/img/pool.jpg">
	<p>
		<p class="bold">Club Pool</p>
		Our club pool will be filled all year round after the renovations, making for the perfect area to complete your Ocean diver training, test
		out new kit or just go for a swim. Our pool is also rented out to a cannoning club and there is talk of some triathlon competitors using 
		the pool to acclimatise.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Club RHIB</p>
		We have our own RHIB (Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boat) which can be used by any diving member to organise your own diving trip or for those
		looking for more of an adventure. We also offer the Boat Handling and the Diver Coxon SDC at our club.
	</p>

	<img src="/assets/img/aed.jpg">
	<p>
		<p class="bold">AED</p>
		The AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a piece of first aid equipment that we hope never to use but that is carried on all trips
		where one is not available. We also teach a AED SDC along with the O2 admin for divers and the first aid course; a large portion of our 
		membership has undertaken these courses.
	</p>


	<p>
		<p class="bold">Regional SDCs</p>
		There is a large number of additional courses that BSAC offers and many of them we can teach in our own clubhouse, else they can be taught
		by one of our neighbouring clubs. These courses are excellently taught by one of our many instructors and are well worth attending. A full list
		of BSAC SDCs can be found on the <a href="http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section=1671&sectionTitle=SDC+Events" target="_blank">BSAC website</a>.

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Mutual Fund</p>
		The mutual fund is a pot of money that, in the event of you loosing a piece of kit, you can claim from to replace your equipment.
		If you would like to join the mutual fund you will need to agree to the <a href="insert-link-here">rules</a> and contribute your share to 
		the fund. Its simply an insurance on your kit, after all, if you paid &pound;500.00 for a torch and lost if overboard, you wouldn't be too happy.
	</p>

	<p>
		<p class="bold">Lecture Theatre</p>
		Our lecture theatre is where we teach all the theory lessons for a course, its also a great place to present something or for other clubs
		to use for there various events. The whole clubhouse and/or the lecture theatre including the pool can also be rented out for parties or events.
