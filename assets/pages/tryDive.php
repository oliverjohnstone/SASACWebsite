<p>Ever wanted to try SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) diving?</br>
Not sure if you will like it or not?</p>

<p>Come along and have a dive in a pool, we have all year round access to the pool in Westminster lodge on a Wednesday evening, 
	and in the summer if you are feeling up for a little more adventure we have our own open air pool at the clubhouse on Sopwell Lane.</p>

<p>We start the evening with an introductory lecture to Scuba Diving, run through some basic signals that you will need in the pool, 
	and then run through the kit you will be wearing during the pool session. After all that we will head down to the water and get wet.</p>

<p>If you realise how much you then love the experience of weightlessness and want to continue on to explore the sub-aqua 
	(below the water level) world, then we offer training from the entry level BSAC Ocean diver right through, Sports Diver, 
	to Dive Leader to BSAC Advanced Diver, and should you then wish to continue on to BSAC First Class we can help mentor you 
	through that level as several members of SASAC have attained BSAC First Class, the highest non instructional award available.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>The cost of a try dive is &pound;15, should you wish to continue on and join the next training course you will receive a &pound;15 discount 
	from your course - so making your try dive a free experience.</p>
