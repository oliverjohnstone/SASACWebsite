	<p>St Albans Sub Aqua club not only provides a great way to go diving with like minded people along with our huge range of advantages but 
		it also also provides a place for people to socialise. All members, not just the diving, can come along on a Wednesday or Friday evening
		to socialise with friends. During the summer we also hold a weekly BBQ on Friday evenings, you can take a dip in the pool, lounge 
		on a sun bed, drink a crisp, cold pint or simply gorge on BBQ food.</p>

	<p>A number of our members also go the extra mile and will organise other, non diving related events such as the French food night, movie night,
		the dinner dance, a lecture series and guest talkers.</p>

	<p>Our annual dinner dances organised by Lisa and Nadine are very popular. Everyone dons their glad rags on and joins in the entertainment.
		The dinner dance is the perfect time for everyone, including past members and diving parters to catch up and to generally have a great time.</p>
